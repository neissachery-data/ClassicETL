Dimensional Modeling utilizing Kimball Theories

Classic ETL. In this project, I take two distinct datasets from the State of California's Data Site. 
One CSV contained Water Quality Results from different counties in California. The other dataset contained data surrounding the Adjusted Gross Income Data. 
I decided to utilize a Constellation Schema and create a Dimensional Model for the data. One fact table as snapshot data and the other fact table as cumulative. 
The dimensions included SCD1, SCD2, SCD3 as well. Tableau was used as the visualization piece for the data.
